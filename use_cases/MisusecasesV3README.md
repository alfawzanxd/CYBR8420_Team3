## Distributed State Files (Supply Chain Attack)

### Diagram


### Misuse Case Analysis
- **Round 1:** System Administrator distributes state files. A malicious contributor attempts to **Inject a Malicious State File**. This threatens the integrity of distribution. 
 
- **Round 2:** The System Administrator introduces **Review State Changes**, what was preiously the push state with review. This mitigation allows reviewers to detect and block injected malicious state files before they are distributed. 
  
- **Round 3:** An attacker escalates by compromising a maintainer account (**Maintainer Account Compromise**). This is less of a "We can trust our people" kind of attack and more of a "our people's account was compromised" attack. This threatens the integrity of the review process. As a countermeasure, **Code Review** (ex: two-person approval) mitigates the risk by requiring stronger verification of changes before distribution. In the counter for the Code Review, you would have to compromise multiple accounts. 

This iterative misuse-case analysis shows that each defense can lead to new attacker strategies, requiring layered mitigations.

### Security Requirements
From this analysis, we derive the following requirements:
1. All state file changes must undergo formal **Review of State Changes** before distribution.  
2. Reviews must require **cryptographic signatures** and **multi-party approval** to prevent a single compromised account from bypassing review.  
3. Administrators must monitor and audit maintainer accounts for unusual activity.  
4. Any state file failing review or missing approval must be automatically blocked from distribution. If it's a legitimate change, there needs to be a re-submission process in place as well.
