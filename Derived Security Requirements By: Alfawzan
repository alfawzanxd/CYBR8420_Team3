Derived Security Requirements:
•	SR-05: Artifact Encryption & Integrity Verification All artifacts and configuration pillars staged to targets must be stored encrypted at rest (via Salt’s GPG renderer or Vault integration) and verified with cryptographic digests/signatures at deployment time. Rationale: Prevents Artifact Poisoning by ensuring only authentic, untampered artifacts are applied
•	SR-06: Deployment Verification & Rollback Trigger Every remote deployment must be followed by automated verification checks (service health, integrity tests). If verification fails, the system must automatically initiate Rollback & Remediation to the last-known-good state. Rationale: Prevents Unauthorized/Unstable Production Deployment from persisting by detecting issues immediately and restoring stability.
