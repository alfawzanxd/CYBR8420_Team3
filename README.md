## Project details

- **Name:** Salt (SaltStack / Salt Project) 
- **Repository:** https://github.com/saltstack/salt 
- **Description:**  
  Salt is an event-driven automation engine/framework, primarily used to manage configuration and orchestration of infrastructure at scale. It employs a master/minion architecture, has modules for states, execution, plugins, templating via Jinja, etc. 
- **Languages / platform:**  
  Mostly Python, shell, Powershell, NSIS, C#, Jinja, and others.  
- **Popularity / activity:**  
  ~14.8k stars, 5.5k forks; active contributions; many external users.

## Hypothetical Operational Environment

- **Environment type:** Enterprise / large cloud + on-premise hybrid infrastructure  
- **Users / stakeholders:** System administrators, DevOps engineers, security team, infrastructure team  
- **Scale:** Hundreds to thousands of managed nodes (servers, virtual machines, network devices)  
- **Security constraints:** Strong internal security policies, compliance (e.g. internal audits), encrypted communications, strict authorization controls, supply chain integrity, etc.  
- **Reliability & availability requirements:** Should have high uptime, ability to recover from network partitioning or node failures.

## Threats Perceived by Users

1. Unauthorized access to master or minion; key compromise.  
2. Eavesdropping or MITM attacks on the transport.  
3. Malicious state or execution modules (supply-chain or plugin).  
4. Misconfiguration leading to privilege escalation.  
5. DoS or overload from too many events or nodes.  
6. Configuration drift or divergence.

## Security Features in Salt
![alt text](https://github.com/smfarjad/CYBR8420_Team3/blob/main/images/key-management.png)
- When a minion checks into the master it sends its public key to the master and the master checks if the key has been accepted.
- The minion will attempt to re-authenticate every 30 seconds until itâ€™s key is accepted.
- If accepted then the master will accept the minion and allow it to accept commands.
- After the keys are sent to the master then the master will need to accept them. This acceptance is done with the salt-key command. Salt keys are used in the following ways:
- RSA keys are used for authentication
- An AES key is used for encryption
  - The AES key is changed every 24 hours by default, or when a minion is deleted.
