### **1. Team Collaboration & Project Management**

**Public GitHub Repository:**
https://github.com/smfarjad/CYBR8420_Team3

**GitHub Project Board:**
https://github.com/users/smfarjad/projects/3

---

### **2. Open-Source Software Selection**

**Software Name:**
Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) v1.20

**Repository Link:**
https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox

---

### **3. Hypothetical Operational Environment & Security Analysis**

**Operational Environment Description:**
[Describe a hypothetical setting, such as a home, office, or enterprise, where the software would be used. Detail the type of users, the kind of data they handle, and the software's role in this environment.]

**Systems Engineering View Diagram:**
[Insert a link to or embed an image of your systems engineering diagram here. The diagram should visually represent the software in its operational environment, showing its interactions with users and other systems.]

**Threats:**
[List the perceived threats to the software in the described environment. Consider potential attackers, their motivations, and the vulnerabilities they might exploit. For example:
- **Threat 1:** Unauthorized access to user data.
- **Threat 2:** Denial of service attacks against the application.
- **Threat 3:** Data tampering.]

**Security Features:**
[List the security features you have identified in the software. For example:
- **Feature 1:** End-to-end encryption for all data.
- **Feature 2:** Role-based access control.
- **Feature 3:** Secure password hashing and storage.]

### **4. Project Motivation & Description**

**Team Motivation for Selection:**
[Explain why your team chose this specific project. This could be due to personal interest, its relevance to a current technology trend, or the clear security challenges it presents.]

**Open-Source Project Description:**
- **What is it?**: [A brief description of the software's purpose.]
- **Contributors**: [Number of contributors and a note on community activity.]
- **Activity**: [General level of activity, e.g., number of commits per week, frequency of new releases.]
- **Use & Popularity**: [Briefly describe the software's user base and popularity.]
- **Languages Used**: [List the primary programming languages used in the project.]
- **Platform**: [On which platforms does the software run? E.g., Web, desktop, mobile.]
- **Documentation Sources**: [List where you found project documentation, e.g., README.md, official website, wiki.]

---

### **5. License & Contribution Procedures**

**Software License:**
[Identify the open-source license (e.g., MIT, GPLv3). Provide a brief summary of what the license permits or restricts.]

**Contribution Procedures & Contributor Agreements:**
[Describe the process for making a contribution to the project. Mention if a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is required and how a new developer would submit a pull request.]

### **6. Security History & Team Reflection**

**Security-Related History:**

The Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) has had a few security-related vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities were tied to external dependencies rather than its own codebase.  

**CVE-2021-28678**  

-Affected ART versions prior to 1.6.1 due to a vulnerable Pillow dependency 

-Fixed in version 1.6.1, updated to a secure version  

**CVE-2021-34552**  

-Also linked to Pillow 

-Remediated in version 1.7.1, updated to a secure version 

**CVE-2021-23437** 

-Dependency flaws linked to Pillow

-Resolved in version 1.8.0, updated to a secure version 

The latest version 1.19.1 (January 22, 2025) has no known security vulnerabilities.
